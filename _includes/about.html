                 <span class="skills">I am completing my last semester at the University of Rochester (yay!) and applying to PhD programs.<br>I was born and raised in South Texas, first-generation college (soon-to-be) graduate, and all about sunny days.<br>I am a research assistant in the UR Kinder Lab and can't wait to get started on my own research!<br>Ultimately, I plan on applying my research to education intervention and policy in low-income school districts.<br>But currently my days are tied up with school, three jobs, and my two rescue dogs.</span>
