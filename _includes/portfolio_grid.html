                        <h4 align="center">Executive Functions</h4>
                    <p align="left">I am interested in investigating how experience with two languages shapes domain-general abilities and how this extends into executive functions such as task-switching, inhibition control, and emotional regulation.</p>
                          <h4 align="center">Word Learning</h4>
                   <p align="center">How does second language experience influences the inferences that children make when learning new words and forming new conceptual categories? How does the bilingual experience contribute to a child's ability to represent words and map them onto concepts?</p>
                        <h4 align="center">Bilingual Advantage</h4>
                    <p align="center">Is there such a thing as a bilingual advantage? There have been conflicting findings among researchers in regards to this topic. I am interested in testing children across the bilingual spectrum (passive to active bilinguals) and finding the threshold at which this advantage can be seen.</p>
