description: I'm not exactly sure why I'm ranking the Chargers lower than most analysts, but their last season just seemed fluky (maybe because they were incredibly lucky getting into the playoffs) and I don't get the sense that they are drafting the right pieces or have the right coaching staff.  Their uniforms wonderful though.
