description: I want to love the Panthers this year, but their front office is making it haaaaard. Even though Kelvin Benjamin looks like the next Calvin Johnson (or Josh Gordon, hopefully not), none of Carolina's receivers have caught a pass in a regular season game. That leaves Greg Olsen as the veteran of the group. I know their defense is going to be strong this year, but it won't mean anything if our offense can't do anything. Steve Smith is going to revenge all over us when we play the Ravens this year.
