description: The colts are going to be boom or bust this year on offense, but I'll be happy to cheer for Hakeem Nicks (HEELS!). I don't know if anyone really expects anything out of their defense, and that's another reason why they're lower than most projections. How long has Mathis been playing anyway? Eventually his effectiveness will run out and I haven't heard of any other playmakers on that defense.
