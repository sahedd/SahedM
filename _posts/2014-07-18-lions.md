description: I guess the Lions were a lot worse than I thought last year. They're kind of a team that's built mainly for fantasy team owners. But I still feel like they have a lot of talent and they just need it to work cohesively. Maybe their new coach Jim Caldwell can do that. Although it's going to be weird going from hyper-aggressive Jim Schwartz to Zen monk Jim Caldwell.
