description: I know I might seem biased against the Vikings, but honestly I don't see Teddy Bridgewater fixing their team. Christian Ponder is clearly a bust. And they don't have anything special on defense to make up for a bad offense that can only score points via Adrian Peterson.  They're almost like the Packers with Scott Tolzien at quarterback.
