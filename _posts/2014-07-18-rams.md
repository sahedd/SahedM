description: I don't know why I thought their chances might be better before the Bradford injury. He's just not that good because he hasn't been able to get more experience with the constant injuries. The sad part is that their defense is loaded. They might have the 3rd or 4th best defense in the NFC West, but the reality is, and I hate to say it, the worst defense in the NFC West is better than the best defense in the NFC North.
