description: This is the year the Chiefs come back down to earth a bit. I was so sure they had a chance to beat Denver last year, but man was I wrong on that one (and unfortunately my brother was right, so I owed him a 6-pack of beer). They're just a well managed team that doesn't lose games it should win, but they can't ever make the upset. Their defense looked great last year because it had so many picks, and it's likely that this number won't stay astronomical this year. Man I love those uniforms though. Never change, Chiefs uniforms... never change.
