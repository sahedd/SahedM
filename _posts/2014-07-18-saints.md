description: I think losing Darren Sproles might be bad for this team. Now their best two running backs are Pierre Tomas and Mark Ingram.  Unless their rookie works out for them, I don't see them having much of a running or screen game. As for defense, still sucks but at least they got rid of Roman Harper, who is older than dirt. What idiotic team traded for him, oh wait, it was the Panthers. Just read a headline that said "Harper Adds Attitude to Secondary."  Because that's what the Panthers were missing... attitude. But anyway, the Saints have at least done a good job at keeping their talent fresh.
