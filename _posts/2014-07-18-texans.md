description: I wanted to put the Texans high in the rankings as my surprise team on the rise, but then I realized... being the worst team in the league a season ago is not a fluke. There must be some issues, and although the Chiefs went from worst in the league to one of the best records last year, they did it because of an entirely new coaching staff. All the Texans got was... Ryan Fitzpatick. I'm not seeing the comeback, but I do love that front seven, and maybe what they were missing last year was the wonderfully kooky Brian Cushing.
