description: As a Packers fan, I've hated the 9ers pretty hard the last three seasons. But they still look very strong so I can't really see them declining this season. They've added a fourth excellent receiver with Stevie Johnson. The other three being Anquan Boldin, Michael Crabtree, and Mario Manningham. Then there's Vernon Davis too. Give those weapons to Cam Newton and the Panthers are your Super Bowl contender, not this team. If Kaepernick doesn't flourish in this offense, he really is garbage.
