description: Ok, I've got to admit, it looks like it's going to be another rough year for this defense, so clearly my bias is pushing past this observation.  I just can't not pick them to win it all when so many analysts are (which is probably jinxing the whole damn thing).  Let's just hope that our offensive playcalling improves and our run and pass game become equally potent poisons to pick. (alliteration... INTENDED)
