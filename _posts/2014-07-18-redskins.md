description: Week 3. Redskins are down by 21. RGIII is like, "I'M GUNNA TAKE THIS TEAM ON MY BACK GUYS!" because he wants to show his teammates that he's tough even though he's done this 500 times. Or maybe it's just because he's really not as good as everyone thinks and he just defaults to running when he can't find anyone open.  Either way... *snap* there goes his leg bone, and with it, the Redskin's season. JUST CHANGE YOUR TEAM'S NAME ALREADY!
