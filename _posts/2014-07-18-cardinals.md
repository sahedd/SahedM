description: I heard they lost Daryl Washington and that this would ruin the chemistry of their excellent defense. What do they honestly have without their defense? I think the Cardinals decided that one of their defining characteristics would be finding supposedly washed up quarterbacks and reviving their careers for a Super Bowl run. It worked with Kurt Warner, but that was pretty lucky. Palmer is no Kurt Warner.
